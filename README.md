# 2023-July
This folder contains my very first coding attempts using Python from July 2023. Lowkey, the hurdle for entry feels very high as I've never really been a "computer person" and have a mini panic attack every time I see an error message. And there are so many buttons on VSCode and it seems trippy.

Let's see where I end up same time next year.

P.S. What in the world does "commit" mean?
